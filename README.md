 # mv-reusable-components

 This is a repo for building components seperate from the inc/fc codebase so they can be installed via npm to either.

 ## Frames

`Frames` is a react component that allows you to use different HTML frames while keeping subviews constant. 

See https://codesandbox.io/s/z67rjrv35m for demo.
